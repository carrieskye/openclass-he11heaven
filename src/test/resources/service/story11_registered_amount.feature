Feature: overview open campus days


As an organiser
I want to be able to see the amount of people that have registered for a session, as well as the max amount of people that can register.
so that I can verify the amount of people that will be attending the session

Scenario: i can see the amount of people that have registered for a session

Given a user
And he is on a sessions overview page
When he looks at a session
Then he can see the amount of people that are registered for that session
